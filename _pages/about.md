- I am now a Senior Engineer at Huawei. I work on low-latency and high-throughput networks for data-centers and public cloud, including congestion control for RDMA/RoCE and its large-scale deployment, scalable transport design. Prior to this, I was a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Computer Science & Technology, Tsinghua University, and I worked on analytical models for content caches (e.g., Web Cache) and geo-based routing for vehicular wireless ad-hoc network.

- I received my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, in Jan, 2016. During my Ph.D. program, I worked in the Lab of Broadband Network Switching Technology and Communications, and my research interests mainly lied in: router architecture, fast packet processing, future Internet architecture, e.g., Named Data Networking (NDN), Software Defined Network (SDN). I got my B.S. degree from Xi’an University of Electronic Science and Technology, Xi’an, China, in 2010.
