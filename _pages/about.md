- I am now a Senior Engineer at Huawei, and I work on low latency network for Cloud Networking, including the congestion control for RoCE and its large-scale deployment. Before this, I was a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Computer Science & Technology, Tsinghua University, and I worked on analytical models for content caches (e.g., Web Cache) and geo-based routing for vehicular wireless ad-hoc network.

- I received my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, in Jan, 2016. I got my B.S. degree from Xi’an University of Electronic Science and Technology, Xi’an, China, in 2010. I joined the Lab of Broadband Network Switching Technology and Communications at Tsinghua University in 2010. My Ph.D. program advisor is Professor Bin Liu.
